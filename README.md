# RFP Management System
### Introduction
"RFP Management" is a comprehensive system facilitating the issuance and management of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) by companies or government agencies. Vendors register on the platform to access RFPs issued by the company. They can submit quotes for consideration, subject to company approval. The system ensures full and open competition while allowing companies to evaluate both responsiveness to specifications and cost-effectiveness. The admin panel enables companies to review all quotes submitted by vendors, streamlining the RFP process efficiently.
